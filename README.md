Repo for Comp Sys 701 Group Research Project

# Folders
## Components
Various VHDL blocks in our processor design. Should contain all the different processor blocks and containers.  
Related components (entities, components, and containers) should be grouped in their own folders.

## Documentation
Any documentation or reports related to this assignment

## Synthesis
Files for running our processor design in Quartus and Model Sim.  
Contains a Quartus project for running on NIOS II and a ModelSim project For final ReCOP compilation.

## TestBenches
ModelSim project and VHDL files for testing the various components.  
Components are stored in \Components and the test files are stored in \TestBenches
